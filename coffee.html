            <h3>Jimmy's Coffee</h3>
            <p>Jimmy's Coffee was founded in 2009 when a King West home was fixed up and made to be a small cafe. From there, it spread into a full fledged business with eight locations spread all over Toronto! With a warm and cozy environment, and an adorable yellow color scheme, you'll surely feel at home!</p>
